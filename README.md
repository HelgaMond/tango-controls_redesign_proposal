This is the first iteration of Tango-site reconstruction.
- Tango_menu_plan.pdf - the way how to transformate upper menu into a new one.
- second_page_content_blocks.pdf - stucture of the pages of menu's items. At the moment the site has 2 pages in terms of design: 
the main page (header, one main content section, footer) and 
the second page (header, right column with some info, main content column and footer).
I propose to change a bit the main page and also add the third page - the one when you click on the menu item.
- NEW_MAIN.png - how I see the main page
- NEW_FOR_DEVELOPERS.png and NEW_COMMUNITY.png - versions of design of how menu items from second_page_content_blocks.pdf may look like.
- Tango_EcoSystem.jpg - version of site-stucture organization in a new menu
